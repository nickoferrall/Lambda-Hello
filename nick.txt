My name is Nick.
Happy, resilient, short!
My favourite hobby is tennis. It's a great challenge both mentally and physically. I try to play 3 times per week but that might be difficult during Lambda School!

Alternate reality:
Japanese sumo wrestler. This is a hobby that I don't participate in but never say never..
